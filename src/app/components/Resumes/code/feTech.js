  <p>
    I have used both pure HTML and HTML templating languages such as Jade or
    Jinja2 in my projects. While the templating languages offer some more
    functionality, I don&#8217;t have a preference either way. As for CSS, I
    was a big fan and user of bootstrap, however, I find myself using the
    Flexbox layout now to lay out and align items in my projects now. Unlike
    with HTML, I also much prefer a pre-processor (Sass/Scss is my
    favorite but I have experience with Less).
